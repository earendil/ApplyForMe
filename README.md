**Prerequisite:** 
  * Create 3 files in your home directory:
    * name: token, add your reed api token, you can get it for free here:https://www.reed.co.uk/developers/Jobseeker
    * name: password, that's your reed account password (plain text atm,feel free to improve security.)
    * name: jobs, leave it empty it will be automatically filled with your job applications.
  * Create a reed account and upload your CV to it.
  * Have firefox installed and have the geckodriver in your home directory. https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases
  
**Warning**
This project is not very child friendly, and was not built to be anything too serious, there's some hardcoding here and there, some uncaught potential exceptions such as if you don't create the files above. So use it at your own discretion.

## Example Usage

You can find usage examples at the bottom of the api.py and automation.py modules, 
I've used these for broadly testing mostly... Yeah I know, no unit testing or anything...
